Hello, my name is Rajan Puri. Welcome to my homepage! 
I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with Ph. D. in Applied Mathematics in May 2019. 
I was a Grad Life Fellow(GLF) (2017-2019) at graduate school and the President of the Mathematics Graduate Student Association(MGSA) (2017-2018) at UNC Charlotte.
I received the national award, the David Merchant International Student Award on June 15, 2018, from the Phi Beta Delta Honor Society for international scholars. 
The national award honors one international student who demonstrates exceptional accomplishments in the areas of scholarship and service.
Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I obtained an MS degree in Mathematics from Tribhuvan University, Nepal, and went on to teach high school math for two years.
I am originally from the beautiful country, Nepal. I have an affinity for the mountains and enjoy being outdoors in nature. 
Please feel free to reach out with any questions that you might have. Thank you!
